# Python Text To Speech

**Description:** A basic implementation of [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html) in python for Text To Speech conversion and downloading the audio file with time-stamp.

To Run Locally:
- Clone the Repo.
- Install [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) using `pip install gTTS` and [playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/) using `pip install playsound`. As these modules are not readily present in python.
- Once installation is done run `python text_to_speech.py` on Windows and `python3 text_to_speech.py` on Mac/Linux.
